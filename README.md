# starwars
This was created with boostrap cdn and a star wars api from https://swapi.dev/. You can change the api character list with insert input number from 1 to 83. 
Example: If you input number 1 it will show Luke skywalker data in the table. If you input number 2 it will show C-3PO data just like in the api.
